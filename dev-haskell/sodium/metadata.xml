		A general purpose Reactive Programming (FRP) system. This is part of a project to
		implement reactive libraries with similar interfaces across a range of programming
		languages at &lt;http://reactiveprogramming.org/&gt;
		
		* Goals include simplicity and completeness.
		
		* Applicative style: Event implements Functor and Behaviour implements Applicative.
		
		* Instead of the common approach where inputs are fed into the front of a monolithic
		\'reactimate\', Sodium allows you to push inputs in from scattered places in IO.
		
		* Integration with IO: Extensible to provide lots of scope for lifting IO into FRP
		logic.
		
		* Push-based imperative implementation.
		
		See the /examples/ directory for test cases and examples.
		
		Changes:
		
		* 0.2.0.0 - Fix some value recursion deadlocks and improve docs;
		
		* 0.3.0.0 - Add mergeWith, make cross asynchronous;
		
		* 0.4.0.0 - API revamp to remove an excess type variable. Parallelism stuff to be rethought;
		
		* 0.5.0.0 - Improved tests cases + add Freecell example, API tweaks;
		
		* 0.5.0.1 - Internal improvements;
		
		* 0.5.0.2 - Fix multiple memory leaks;
		
		* 0.6     - Minor API changes, particular with accum;
		
		* 0.6.0.1 - ghc-7.8 compatibility;
		
		* 0.6.0.2 - Fix memory leak - see memory-test-8 &amp; memory-test-8a;
		
		* 0.7.0.0 - Add split primitive.
		
		* 0.8.0.0 - Add executeIO primitive.
		
		* 0.9.0.0 - Rename changes to updates. Rename values to value.
		
		* 0.10.0.0 - Add Monoid instance to Event - thanks Finlay Thompson.
