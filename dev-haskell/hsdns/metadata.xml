		This library provides an asynchronous DNS resolver on top
		of GNU ADNS &lt;http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~ian/adns/&gt;.
		Not all options are supported, but A, MX, and PTR lookups
		work nicely. There is also support for retrieving generic
		RR types, CNAMEs, and for NSEC zone walking. The library
		can be expected to work with fine ADNS 1.4 or later. It
		might also work with version ADNS 1.3, but that hasnâ€™t
		been tested.
		
		The example program adns-reverse-lookup.hs demonstrates
		how the resolver is used. Given a list of host names on
		the command line, it performs an A/PTR double-lookup and
		checks whether the records are consistent. The
		output is printed in the order in which the DNS responses
		arrive:
		
		&gt; $ ./adns-reverse-lookup cryp.to localhost www.example.com
		&gt; OK: localhost &lt;-&gt; 127.0.0.1
		&gt; FAIL: cryp.to -&gt; 217.19.183.102 -&gt; ["zuse.cryp.to"]
		&gt; OK: www.example.com &lt;-&gt; 192.0.32.10
